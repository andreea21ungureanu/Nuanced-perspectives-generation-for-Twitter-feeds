          <p>
            Social media platforms such as Twitter don’t provide a way to show the broader context of a subject. Commonly, the content that the users are exposed to 
            reflects their opinions as social media tries to personalise the content, which can interpose a false feeling of rightness. This can cause bias and confusion.
            Research has shown that tweets can be tagged with emotions and that emotions can be detailed using psychology methods. Tweets can then be arranged in contrasting 
            groups by using clustering methods. This project aims to untangle the nuanced and complex data that is contained inside Twitter by creating a framework that depicts a 
            set of perspectives generated by analyzing and tagging tweets. Based on the framework formulation, the following research questions are being answered:  
            ”How effective is to present multiple perspectives to a Twitter user in order to make their views more moderate?” and ”How can the prevalence of the echo 
            chamber effect be reduced on Twitter?”. In this context, a perspective refers to the views one holds towards a subject.

            Twitter data was collected, annotated with emotions and clustered based on those emotions. From there, text perspectives and visual representations of perspectives on 
            different subjects were generated and displayed with the use of a web application. After running the user testing, the results have shown that the users are more likely to 
            improve their understanding or to moderate their views after using the framework proposed rather than just using Twitter.
            The results have shown that the prevalence of the echo chamber effect can be reduced on Twitter by presenting the user with a framework incorporating context agnostic 
            content about subjects that the users are biased on.
